            <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
            <p>My family is obsessed with movies. For a suburban immigrant family, it was our way of escaping from our
                monotonous lives to something more imaginative and exciting. We could pretend to be somewhere, to be
                someone else. Growing up, I watched my favorite movies over and over until I could play them entirely in
                my head. They brought me comfort. As I grew up, I realized my fondest memories were tied to a longing
                and nostalgia for times and places that didnâ€™t exist.</p>

            <p>When I was 18, I began learning film photography with a small plastic toy camera that looked like a milk
                carton. Looking through the prints off the very first roll, I had that same feeling of nostalgia. The
                pictures were a little blurry and had many light leaks, but all of those elements together made me feel
                like I was recalling something from long ago. I think this is the way these kinds of moments are stored
                in our memories: dreamy, imperfect, and bonded by the emotions you felt when you pressed the shutter
                button.</p>

            <p>Through the lens of my camera, I could frame my life like the movies I watched growing up. The most
                mundane, everyday moments became romantic. As I grew and traveled, I took my camera everywhere, and
                found that every city is strung together by these mundane moments. I wanted to bottle the emotions I
                felt standing in the middle of the street, trying to absorb every piece of it, and I hoped that
                everything I saw through my eyes and felt in my heart would meld into a single photograph.</p>
